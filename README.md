This was the "Masterkey" project for my final year submission that occured on the month of April 7, 2022. The goal of my game was to make it entirely dependent on typing commands through a pseudo-CLI.

Commands would be utilitarian and there would be a dedicated command for any kind of function. From navigating the menus to moving your character in a multiplayer match. While the concept sounded interesting, its execution was hilariously bad.

The code written here is the worst kind of netcode to ever exist in the face of humanity and programmers in general and for anyone planning on ever exploring the project, I recommend drinking lots of beer before navigating through the code base. Part of the reason was me not getting enough time to realize an idea that was very overblown for just one person to work on it.

Long story short, the invigilator didn't even peer into my project or the thesis that I prepared and asked me questions that were out of the scope of the entire thing. Imagine locking yourself indoors from the beginning of the year till April, half-assing a project and then this. Maybe I was lucky but overall, it was a life-changing event. I underwent depression and actually started touching grass and going outdoors a lot more. So yes, bad code does change a person either for the better or for the worse.
